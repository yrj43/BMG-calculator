# Rate Combination Finder — React Static App (No Babel)

This version removes Babel and JSX to avoid CDN runtime errors. It uses React UMD with `React.createElement` in plain JavaScript so it runs cleanly on GitHub Pages.

## Deploy
- Upload `index.html` to your repo root.
- Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / Root.
